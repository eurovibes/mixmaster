Mixmaster Version 3.0

As I write this, Mixmaster is over a decade old. This incarnation of the
codebase was begun almost exactly 10 years ago, and the idea conceived
nearly half that again. Despite many changes in the social, political,
legal, and technological landscape, Mixmaster has continuously provided
anonymity services to those who need it throughout this time. 

Many people have helped with the development of Mixmaster during its
long history. Lance Cottrell wrote the original 1.x and 2.0.x versions. 
Ulf Möller contributed significantly to the 2.0.x versions, and wrote
the core code for 2.9 from scratch. I'd like to give special thanks to
Peter Palfrader, Colin Tuckley, and Steve Crook. As the core members of
the Mixmaster development team, without their tireless efforts, this
project would not be sustainable.

Additionally, I would like to honor the memory of a former valued member 
of the development team, Janis Jagars, whose work made this release 
possible, though sadly, he passed away tragically before it was 
completed. "Disastry", you are missed.

Mixmaster uses Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler's compression library zlib,
Philip Hazel's Perl Compatible Regular Expressions library, the ncurses
library (originally written by Zeyd Ben-Halim and Eric Raymond), and
OpenSSL (based on work by Eric Young and Tim Hudson.)

I have compiled below a partial list of people who have contributed to
Mixmaster's success, through suggestions, bug reports, patches, or other
contributions. Please report any omissions to me.

There have been numerous anonymous contributions to this project as well.
While we obviously can't thank the contributor(s) by name, they are still
very much appreciated.

Thanks also to all the remailer operators, who give their time and service
(and perform what is too often a thankless job) to ensure that our right
to anonymous speech is preserved.

Finally, thank you to my colleagues at COSIC, and my advisors, Prof. 
Bart Preneel and Prof. David Chaum, for their support of my work on this 
project.
