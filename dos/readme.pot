Mixmaster and Potato Software    (ReadMe.POT)
---------------------------------------------
    This document details installation of Mixmaster for use with the following
    remailer utilities:

        Jack B. Nymble v1.2
        Potato v2.3

    If your version number is higher, check the program documentation for the
    latest information or changes.

    This document is intended for distribution with Mixmaster 2.0.5.


Installing Mixmaster 2.0.5
--------------------------
    Download the Mixmaster DOS binary ("mix205.zip").  Create a directory
    named "C:\MIX", or similar. Unzip the archive to this directory.

    If you use Jack B. Nymble:

        Note: Jack B. Nymble v1.2 includes an installation wizard which will
        complete the required steps below. Select Tools|Wizards|Install
        Mixmaster.  Or:

        In Options|Global Settings|Remailers|Mix Path, enter the path to
        Mixmaster, C:\MIX

        In the Stats Book, select Tools|Update Mix List and Keys.


    If you use Potato:

        In POT.INI find the line "---mix", and enter (for example):
           ---mix=C:\MIX

        Download the current type2.lis and pubring.mix files, and save
        them to your Mixmaster directory. (See below for links.)



    Optional:  If you installed Mixmaster to a directory other than C:\MIX,
    you may wish to set the MIXPATH environment variable in Autoexec.bat,
    particularly if you are using the older Mixmaster 2.0.3 independently, or
    with other software. However, neither Potato nor Jack B. Nymble require
    this variable with Mixmaster 2.0.4 or 2.0.5.



Using Jack B. Nymble with Mixmaster
-----------------------------------
    Jack B. Nymble supports all current client features of Mixmaster 2.0.5,
    including multi-part messages, random remailers, and redundant message
    chains.

    In Message Books, Mixmaster remailers are used the same way as Cypherpunk
    remailers.  Press the Mix button to toggle between the two.

    When using Mixmaster remailers, the To field may contain multiple addresses
    separated with commas.  (No spaces.)

    The Stats Book will update your type2.lis and pubring.mix files.  Select
    Tools|Update Mix List and Keys.  (The URLs used to obtain these files may be
    customized in JBN's Options|Global Settings|Remailers.)

    Each time you update the Stats Book, JBN also updates Mixmaster's
    mixmaste.htm file in the Mixmaster directory.



Using Potato with Mixmaster
---------------------------
    Potato supports all current client features of Mixmaster 2.0.5, including
    multi-part messages, random remailers, and redundant message chains.

    Press Alt-M to toggle CPunk/Mixmaster remailers.  In the To field, enter one
    or more addresses, separated by commas.  (No spaces.) Select remailers in
    the M1-M5 fields by pressing PageUp/PageDown.  In the Hd fields, enter any
    additional headers you wish included.  (Headers may also be added using the
    three variable headers, and using X-Header.txt - consult Potato.txt.)

    Potato requires the user to update the Mixmaster type2.lis and pubring.mix
    files, which contain the remailer list and keys, and mixmaste.htm, which
    contains statistics used by Mixmaster's random remailer functions.  For the
    locations of these files, consult the links at the end of this document.
