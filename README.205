Mixmaster Version 2.0.5
=============

Mixmaster 2.0.5 is intended to be the final release of the Mixmaster 2.0.x
source tree. It has been superceeded by an entirely rewritten version of 
Mixmaster, which uses the same (Type II) message format. At the time of 
this release, Mixmaster 2.9.1 is the current stable release, and 
Mixmaster 3.0b2 is the current beta release. Please consider using a 
modern version of Mixmaster unless you specifically need the 2.0.x 
version.


See the file CHANGES for detailed version history of this source tree.


Changes in version 2.0.5:
=============

The remailer drops messages without timestamps, and messages with future
timestamps.  The timestamp extension introduced in version 2.0.4 is now
nearly universally used, and thus requiring it protects against
partitioning attacks. Likewise, dropping future timestamps protects users
who have skewed clocks from being partitioned.

The precompiled binary version of Mixmaster 2.0.5 was compiled with 
OpenSSL version 0.9.6m.


New features in version 2.0.4:
=============

* Format extension for better protection against replay attacks: 
  Messages contain a fuzzy timestamp, and are discarded after they
  reach a certain age.
* new Install script - easy installation.
* several bug fixes.
* support for the list of reliable Mixmaster remailers.
* improved chain selection, can send message via multiple paths to
  increase reliablity.
* new remailer features: "middle only" remailer, exponential pool,
  filter for unwanted header lines, anti-spam From address.
* improved randomness handling, support for /dev/random.
* message compression.
* can be compiled under DOS/Windows.
* updated documentation.

Changes from version 2.0.3:
===========================

* New mixmaster.conf entries, with reasonable default values.
* The blocking lines are interpreted as regular expressions unless
  -DUSE_RX is deleted in the Makefile.
* The disclaimer is added when messages are sent from the pool.
