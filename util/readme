This directory contains some small shell scripts that allow you to send
Mixmaster messages in a convenient way from within your mail and news
reading software:

  R    reply to a message anonymously.
  G    send group reply anonymously.
  M    mail a new message anonymously.
  F    post an anonymous followup.
  D    send dummy message.

To reply to a message, pipe it to one of the scripts `R', `G' or `F'.
Most mail and news readers allow you to do so by typing `|' and the
script name.

The scripts will prepare the message and start your standard editor.
There is an additional pseudo-header `Chain:' which allows you to
select remailers.  You may chose remailers by their short name or
their number.  As usual, `0' means that Mixmaster will randomly chose
a reliable remailer.

If the file ~/.anonsig exists, it will be included as a signature.
For obvious reasons, this should be a symbolic link to an encrypted
directory.


The script `M' provides the same user interface for sending a new
message. It can be run directly from the shell.
