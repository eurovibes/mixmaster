Description: Anonymous remailer client and server
 Mixmaster is the reference implementation of the type II remailer protocol
 which is also called Mixmaster.
 .
 An anonymous remailer is a computer service that privatizes your email. A
 remailer allows you to send electronic mail to a Usenet news group or to a
 person without the recipient knowing your name or your email address.
 Anonymous remailers provide protection against traffic analysis.
 .
 This package provides both a client and an optional server installation.
