mixmaster (3.0b2-5) unstable; urgency=high

  * Backport a fix from upstream:
    In two functions in keymgt.c we had allocated a buffer of 33 bytes
    when if fact we were using one more - 34 - bytes.  This buffer
    overflow is exposed when building with gcc 4.x, it never was exposed
    with previous compilers because they apparently layed out the stack
    differently.
    The result of this buffer overflow is that a single 0-byte will be
    written at the end of the buffer.  At that position on the stack
    there is (at least in the previous build) a saved local variable
    from a calling function.  This local variable is a pointer to a
    BUFFER struct and this pointer has its least significant byte
    set to zero.
    This prevents mixmaster from properly decrypting incoming type2
    messages.  It's not likely that this can be exploited to execute
    arbitrary code, tho evidence or argument to the contrary are of course
    welcome.
    Upstream patch:
    http://svn.noreply.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/trunk/Mix/Src/keymgt.c?rev=929&r1=766&r2=929
    Closes: #418662

mixmaster (3.0b2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Depend on debconf | debconf-2.0 instead of just debconf (closes: #332027).
  * Fix typo in mixmaster manpage (closes: #282686).
  * Remove some debconf questions that modified conffiles which was violating
    policy.
  * Fix bashisms in mixmaster.config.  We used -a and -o in test.
  * Update standards-version to 3.6.2 from 3.6.1.
  * Depend on adduser since we use it to create a new user in postinst.
  * A user reported the problem that mixmaster - when started from an init
    script - asked for a passphrase and therefore locked his entire boot
    process until somebody hit return.  I don't see how this could happen,
    but add a new --no-ask-passphrase that makes it never ask for the
    remailer's passphrase on startup, even if we don't have it compiled in,
    don't have it in the config file, don't have it in the environment and we
    are, on a tty.  Use that option in our init script  (Closes: #294664).
  * Update allpingers.txt file.
  * Remove parsedate.tab.c in clean target - it's created with bison from the
    corresponding .y file.

  * Update allpingers list.
  * Thanks file is part of upstream again.
  * Changed Standards-Version in control to 3.6.1 - no changes made.

mixmaster (3.0b1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * s/useable/usable/ in README.Debian.
  * Update allpingers list.
  * Update debian/rules:
    - mix.1 was renamed to mixmaster.1 in the source distribution.
    - the source distribution makefile builds a mixmaster executeable,
      no longer a mix executable.
    - The template Makefile is called Makefile.in again, it was
      Makefile-sh.in previously.
  * Update debian/copyright to use updated list of copyright holders
    from upstream COPYRIGHT file.
  * The upstream tarball failed to ship with the THANKS file, adding
    it to the Debian package from the trunk.

mixmaster (3.0a9-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upstream CVS snapshot.
  * Update allpingers.
  * Include upstream HISTORY file as changelog.
  * Fixed setting in remailer.conf:
    the option to set the source block file is called SOURCEBLOCK,
    not SOURCE-BLOCK.
  * Document how to use user specific stats (closes: #166863).
  * Uses dh_installppp to install ppp ip-up file (closes: #212904).
  * Therefore build depends on debhelper >> 4.1.68.
  * Also build depend on bison now.
  * Use true/false instead of yes/no in debconf templates (closes: #214298).
  * Nym support removed from mixmaster's default built.  This does not
    fix, but closes: #193533.
  * Mention parsedate's license in debian/copyright.
  * Don't mention yes or no in templates as different frontends may
    label these options differently or have checkboxes for instance.

mixmaster (2.9.0-3) unstable; urgency=low

mixmaster (2.9b39+2.9b40pre1-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed debconf defaults: Operating a remailer now defaults to No.
    Previously there was no default at all. Also changed the priority of the
    question to low - Those few who will run a serverice can always do
    dpkg-reconfigure which defaults to low anyway.
    (closes: #171544: mixmaster: NOT running a server should be the default)
  * Changed long description a bit.
  * lintian says: dpkg-reconfigure only stops daemons as of version 1.2.9. To
    ensure dpkg-reconfigure can correctly start the daemon after
    reconfiguration, packages should declare a dependency on that version of
    debconf. Did so.

mixmaster (2.9b39+2.9b40pre1-6) unstable; urgency=low

mixmaster (2.9b39+2.9b40pre1-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Ensure /var/lib/mixmaster has the right permissions using
    dpkg-statoverride in postinst.
    This closes the problem of having the stats unreadable for
    normal users if the default permissions on new users'
    homedirectories are set to something not 0755 in adduser's
    configuration file adduser.conf (closes: #166795).

  * Use the correct user in an example in README.Debian.
    (closes: #165147: README.Debian: it is "mixmaster" not "remailer")
  * Minor documentation fixes for mixmaster-update(1).
  * mixmaster-update: if we don't have write permissions on the
    destination files suggest using --destination or running as a
    different user (closes: #166073: shouldn't mixmaster-update binary be
    placed in /usr/sbin ?).

  * Set rate to 100, poolsize to 0 and sendpooltime to 0
    in default client configuration.
  * Removed unused maildir.c from current source - it's not
    yet in the stable mixmaster tree. Forgot to clean it up
    in CVS.
  * Add missing build time dependency on zlib1g-dev (closes: #164738).
  * Clarify license's mention of patents in debian/copyright.

mixmaster (2.9b39+2.9b40pre1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remove dependency on MTA - in theory mixmaster can work with
    the built in smtp client and a relay host. Incoming mail for
    the remailer can be done via POP3.
    MTA is now only recommended.
  * Suggest: mutt. Mutt is a nice email client that has built in
    mixmaster support (it knows how to call it, nothing more).
    Users wishing to use it should configure mutt to use
    /usr/bin/mimxaster-filter as mixmaster client as it handles
    filtering out your From: line (which mutt leaves in - according
    to the developers Not A Bug[TM] *sigh*).

mixmaster (2.9b39+2.9b40pre1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * CVS Snapshot of stable mixmaster tree right after 2.9b39 release.
    Backported patches are pid file writing, sane SIGTERM handling
    and MAILIN stuff.
    This version does not (yet?) include Maildir writing support while
    the previous snapshops taken from the development tree did. I don't
    think this is a problem tho.
  * mixmaster-update makes use of allpingers.txt maintained at
    http://www.noreply.org/allpingers/ rather than its own built in list.
    Therefore we have a new config file: allpingers.txt.
  * Default source changed from shinn to randseed (for no real reason).
  * Organization, Hash-MsgID, Poolsize, Autoreply, Binfilter and Autoblock
    are no longer asked via debconf. Go edit the config file with ed(1).
  * New DFSG free license.
  * Upload to the Debian Archive
    (closes: #85612: ITP: mixmaster -- an anonymous remailer).
