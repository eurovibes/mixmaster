Thank you for contacting the Abuse Complaint Administrator
of the %RMN.

We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience that you may have
experienced as a result of inappropriate use of this system by a
particular individual.

The purpose of this anonymous remailer is to permit individuals
including crime victims, domestic violence victims, persons in recovery,
and others, such as those living under oppressive regimes, to
communicate confidentially in a manner that ensures their privacy under
even the most adverse conditions. Unfortunately, there will always be a
very small percentage of individuals that choose to abuse the anonymity
that this and similar systems worldwide afford to insult, harass, or
send otherwise unwelcome email.

The operator of this remailer does not condone such messages, or their
content, in any way.  

Just as the Post Office is unable to prevent abuse of the mail system as
long as there are public mailboxes into which a person can drop a letter
without including a return address, this remailer cannot preemptively
prevent irresponsible individuals from using this system to send
inappropriate messages. However, unlike the Post Office, this remailer
enables you to assure that you will not be inconvenienced by users of
this remailer in the future.

How to block your email address from receiving email from the 
%RMN:

To block the users of this remailer from sending email to your address,
please send a message to <%RMA>
containing the line

DESTINATION-BLOCK

anywhere in the body text of the email.  You can simply reply to this
message using your email program and send back this entire message for
your current email address to be permanently blocked from users of the
%RMN.

If you wish to block additional email addresses that you may use from
receiving email though this remailer, please reply to this email with a
line similar to

DESTINATION-BLOCK my_other_email_address@my_domain.com

You must include one such line per email address that you wish to block.
You can include more than one line in your reply.
==========================================================================

How to block an entire domain from receiving email from the 
%RMN:

If you are the legitimate root administrator or postmaster of a domain,
you may request that all email addresses served by you domain are
blocked from receiving email from this remailer . To place this block,
please send the following line as "root" or "postmaster" to
<%RMA> in the body text of your email:

DESTINATION-BLOCK @domain_to_be_blocked.com

==========================================================================
Note that there are similar remailer systems in operation on the
Internet that not affiliated with the %RMN.

Since the administrator of this remailer has no influence on those other
systems and is likely to be unaware of many of these other systems, a
destination block that you may choose to request by replying to this
email is only effective for the %RMN,
not for similar systems that may exist on the Internet.

==========================================================================

How to obtain the name of the sender of an email that you received
though this remailer:

This remailer uses the Mixmaster anonymous remailer software. The
Mixmaster software has been carefully designed to withstand attack by
even the most severe regimes in which torture is a common means of
inquiry and basic human rights are nonexistent.  As such, it is
impossible to determine the original sender of an email that has passed
through this system.

The administrator of this system is technically unable to determine the
original sender of a message that has passed through this remailer, no
matter how much the administrator may desire to do so, even if the
administrator were ordered to do so by legal or extra-legal means. We
regret any inconvenience this necessary safety protection may cause to
some recipients of undesired emails.

Remember: you can prevent future unwanted emails sent to you via this
remailer by simply replying to this message.

Sincerely,

-- The %RMN Administrator
