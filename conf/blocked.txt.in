Subject: %RMN Blocking Confirmation 
Reply-To: Abuse Complaint Administrator <%CA>

Thank you for contacting the Abuse Complaint Administrator of the
%RMN.
The administrator has processed your request to not receive emails from
this anonymous remailer. This remailer will no longer send emails to the
email address(es) for which you requested a block. Note that due to fact
that Internet email can arrive at the destination out-of-sequence, it is
possible, though unlikely, that you may receive emails from this
remailer that were sent prior to your blocking request, but have not yet
been received by you.

We again wish to apologize for any inconvenience that may have been
caused to you.

Sincerely,

-- The %RMN Administrator
