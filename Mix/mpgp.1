.SH DESCRIPTION
Mixmaster is an anonymous remailer. mpgp is a light-weight OpenPGP
implementation, primarily used to diagnose issues with OpenPGP keys and
messages handled by the Mixmaster remailer software.
.PP
mpgp can encrypt, decrypt and sign a message using the Mixmaster 
OpenPGP library. The message is read from the standard input or the 
specified \fIfilename\fR. The output will be written to the standard 
output. When called without arguments mpgp decrypts from the standard 
input. It asks for a passphrase when needed.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B "\-h"
Print a summary of command line options.
.TP
.B "\-e"
Encrypt a message with the first OpenPGP key from the public key ring 
whose contains \fIkeyname\fR as a substring.
.TP
.B "\-s"
Make a signature of the message with the first OpenPGP key from the secret
key ring, or the first key whose contains \fIkeyname\fR as a substring if
specified.
.TP
.B "\-c"
Encrypt with symmetric cipher only.
.TP
.B "\-C"
Encrypt with symmetric cipher only using the new OpenPGP format.
.TP
.B "\-d"
Decrypt a message using \fIpassphrase\fR if specified or asking for it if
needed. It also verifies its signature.
.TP
.B "\-g\fR[\fBr\fR]"
Generate new OpenPGP key pair with the given \fIkeyname\fR as user ID. If
\fBr\fR is specified the OpenPGP key will be created using the RSA 
algorithm, otherwise the ElGamal algorithm will be used. \fIbits\fR is the 
key length and its default value is 1024.
.TP
.B "\-a\fR[\fB+\-\fR]"
Create an ASCII OpenPGP armored message. If \fB\-\fR is specified mpgp 
will remove ASCII armor.
.TP
.B "\-b"
Specifies that the message is in binary format.
.SH CONFIGURATION
The Mixmaster OpenPGP module reads its configuration from the file
.B mix.cfg
in its working directory.  The configuration file consists of lines of
the type
.PP
.I VARIABLE       values
.PP
and of comments, which begin with a
.B #
character.
.PP
.TP
.B PGPPUBRING
Path to your public OpenPGP key ring. Default:
.BR ~/.pgp/pubring.pgp .
(Windows default: PGP registry value.)
.TP
.B PGPSECRING
Path to your secret OpenPGP key ring. Default:
.BR ~/.pgp/secring.pgp .
(Windows default: PGP registry value.)
.SH FILES
These filenames can be overridden by setting the corresponding configuration
option (given in parentheses).
.TP
.B mix.cfg
Mixmaster configuration file.
.TP
.B pubring.pgp
OpenPGP public keys (\fBPGPPUBRING\fP).
.TP
.B secring.pgp
OpenPGP secret keys (\fBPGPSECRING\fP).
.SH SEE ALSO
.BR mixmaster (1),
.BR pgp (1),
.BR gpg (1).
.SH HISTORY
The
.BR mpgp 
command was written by Ulf Moeller as a test suite for Mixmaster 
2.9's internal OpenPGP support. It was enhanced and debugged primarily
by Janis Jagars for use as a light-weight stand-alone OpenPGP application.
