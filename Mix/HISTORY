1999-12-19      2.9beta20  Output remailer RSA keys separately from the
                             DSA/ElGamal keys to avoid problems with old

                           --nym option bug fix (by Adam Back).

2001-09-11      2.9beta24  Changed pool.c to allow Mixmaster keys to pass
                             even when binary blocking is enabled. Note that
                             the solution is not a nice one: It does not
                             recognize Mix keys, it simply allows 10 lines of
                             binary garbage instead of 3. This should be enough
                             for Mix keys to come through (by Peter Palfrader).
                           Fixed a bug in pgpdata.c affecting v3 OpenPGP keys.

                           If the sender email address or IP address matches
                             anything in source.blk, ignore the message (by
                             cmeclax).
                           Added support for the Mutt -T option (by Bill
                             O'Hanlon).

                             Markus Stöger).
                           Added support for remailer-adminkey replies to
                             provide a better way for remops to distribute
                             their keys. (by Markus Stöger).
                           Fixed errors with pcre2.08 (by Rodney Thayer).
                           Added long command option --type-list for the -T

                           Partial packets now properly expire if not
                             reassembled (by cmeclax).
                           Fixed an address blocking error introduced in

                             middleman remailers (by Kat).
                           Reworked the OpenSSL version check in the

                             dest.blk. The dest block engine does not under-
                             stand shell globs. Either substring matches or
                             regexen.
                           Fixed -T switch: if type2.list is not available fall
                             back to pubring.mix.
                           USE_IDEA is no longer default in config.h. It always
                             gets defined by the Install script instead.
                           Only create OpenPGP RSA keys if we compiled with

                           Make smtp sending similar to local /usr/lib/sendmail
                             sending (wrt header/body seperation;
                             Closes: #482052).
                           Add X-Loop header on mailbox forwarded messages.
                           Several small fixes by Sami Farin et al.

2002-08-20	2.9b37     OpenPGP enhancement release (fixes by Disastry).
                           Fix a small bug in pgpdata.c that stopped Mixmaster
                             from reading cipher preferences.
                           Fixed Passphrase reading in mpgp (the test program)
                             on Windows platform.
                           Add Hash: header when clearsigning.
                           Properly handle RSA keys whose key size is not a 
                             multiple of 64.
                           Remove leading zeros from MPI.
                           Use MDC packets whenever possible.
                           List CAST5 and AES128 in cipher preferences.
                           Now displays Mixmaster version in the PGP version
                             header for non remailer/nym messages.

2002-??-??	2.9b38     Applied Maildir feature patch by drt@un.bewaff.net,
                             with some changes by PP:
                             MAILBOX can now be a Maildir (closes: #586223).
                           Install script deals with lack of patented IDEA
                             algorithm in a sane way (closes: #479020).
                           New option MAILIN that can be set to either a mbox
                             or Maildir folder. New mail will be read from it
                             and the folder cleared every time Mixmaster
                             processes its pool (closes: #597043).
