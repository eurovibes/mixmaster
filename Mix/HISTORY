1999-12-19      2.9beta20  Output remailer RSA keys separately from the
                             DSA/ElGamal keys to avoid problems with old
                             versions of PGP.
                           Messages in mail folders can be deleted. Nym

                           --nym option bug fix (by Adam Back).

2001-09-11      2.9beta24  Changed pool.c to allow Mixmaster keys to pass
                             even when binary blocking is enabled. Note that
                             the solution is not a nice one: It does not
                             recognize Mix keys, it simply allows 10 lines of
                             binary garbage instead of 3. This should be enough
                             for Mix keys to come through (by Peter Palfrader).
                           Fixed a bug in pgpdata.c affecting v3 OpenPGP keys.
                           (by Michael Young).

                             Palfrader).
                           If the sender email address or IP address matches
                             anything in source.blk, ignore the message (by
                             cmeclax).
                           Added support for the Mutt -T option (by Bill
                             O'Hanlon).

                           Added support for multiple dest.blk files. This
                             is needed for the Remailer Abuse Blocklist (by
                             Markus Stöger).
                           Added support for remailer-adminkey replies to
                             provide a better way for remops to distribute
                             their keys. (by Markus Stöger).
                           Fixed errors with pcre2.08 (by Rodney Thayer).
                           Added long command option --type-list for the -T
                             option, and updated help (by Len Sassaman).

                           OpenSSL and OpenBSD Install script issues
                             addressed.

2001-12-16      2.9b33     Support for Mixmaster as a service on Windows
                             platforms added (by Disastry).
                           Problem transparently remixing to Type I remailers

                           Fixed inconsistencies between software name and
                             package name.

2002-07-01      2.9b34     Encrypt-to directive is now supported.
                           Partial packets now properly expire if not
                             reassembled (by cmeclax).
                           Fixed an address blocking error introduced in

                             middleman remailers (by Kat).
                           Reworked the OpenSSL version check in the

                           Have the Makefile list all prerequisites for each

                           Change »majordomo@*« to »majordomo@« in default
                             dest.blk. The dest block engine does not under-
                             stand shell globs. Either substring matches or
                             regexen.
                           Fixed -T switch: if type2.list is not available fall
                             back to pubring.mix.
                           USE_IDEA is no longer default in config.h. It always
                             gets defined by the Install script instead.
                           Only create OpenPGP RSA keys if we compiled with

                           The -G option now forces creation of new keys even in
                             client mode (Closes: #585176).
                           Random Documentation updates.

                           Make smtp sending similar to local /usr/lib/sendmail
                             sending (wrt header/body separation;
                             Closes: #482052).
                           Add X-Loop header on mailbox forwarded messages.
                           Several small fixes by Sami Farin et al.
                           Detach correctly in daemon mode.
                           Minor Install script fixes.

2002-08-20      2.9b37     OpenPGP enhancement release (fixes by Disastry).
                           Fix a small bug in pgpdata.c that stopped Mixmaster
                             from reading cipher preferences.
                           Fixed Passphrase reading in mpgp (the test program)
                             on Windows platform.
                           Add Hash: header when clearsigning.
                           Properly handle RSA keys whose key size is not a
                             multiple of 64.
                           Remove leading zeros from MPI.
                           Use MDC packets whenever possible.
                           List CAST5 and AES128 in cipher preferences.
                           Now displays Mixmaster version in the PGP version
                             header for non remailer/nym messages.

2002-09-11      2.9b38     Install script deals with lack of patented IDEA
                             algorithm in a sane way (closes: #479020).
                           Compiled-in passphrase is now deprecated.
                           When expiring packet ids from id.log also expire
                             packets that are dated more than half a year in
                             the future.  That way we get rid of invalid
                             packets introduced by the switch to a binary file.
                           The stats in remailer-stats replies always had a
                             peak at 00:00 GMT which was wrong. Fixed.
                             (closes: #597688).
                           Fixed a bug with reading armored keyrings consisting
                             of more than one armored block or having comments
                              in front of the one armored block.
                           In RSA PGP keys, we now set e=0x11.
                           Mixmaster now deletes error and temporary files
                             older than PACKETEXP time along with expired
                             partial packets.
                           Linux PPC fixes (and all other archs where char is
                             unsigned).

2002-10-07      2.9b39     Added a new feature, --store-mail (-I), which will
                             deliver an encrypted mix packet to the message pool
                             without attempting being decrypted.
                           Made minor updates for WIN32 DLL.
                           When sending type II messages interactively you may
                             now choose a middleman remailer as the last hop
                             in your chain (closes: #481244).
                           If a footer.txt file exists its content will be
                             appended to outgoing messages leaving the remailer
                             network at this hop (closes: #490117).
                           List known remailers in remailer-conf reply (closes:
                             #480330).
                           The files created with "SENDMAIL outfile" have
                             different names now to scale beyond 10k files
                             (closes: #587593).
                           Fixed the "is a mailfolder" checking for -f.
                           Various fixes for Mixmaster when not using ncurses.
                           Added new option --config to allow loading of
                             configuration information from an alternate file.
                           POOL is now used correctly if set in mix.cfg.
                           ASCII armor checksum is now verified on PGP keys.
                           Corrected a bug where 1/4096 of pgp messages was
                             destroyed due an improper armor checksum
                             interpretation.
                           Added password-based authenticated SMTP for mix.
                             Currently, only AUTH LOGIN is supported.
                           Mixmaster now handles <CR><LF> in pubring.mix.
                           Removed incorrect NT service checks in mix.c.
                           Mixmaster now keeps no stats in client mode.
                           The pool is autmatically checked for waiting
                             messages in the client configuration.
                           Mixmaster now bears a DFSG-compliant license.
                           Fixed permissions on tarball release.
                           Documentation updates.

2002-10-16      2.9b40     New option MAILIN that can be set to either a mbox
                             or Maildir folder. New mail will be read from it
                             and the folder cleared every time Mixmaster
                             processes its pool, or at MAILINTIME intervals
                             (closes: #597043).
                           The Mixmaster daemon now writes a pid file.
                           Mixmaster in daemon mode now catches SIGTERM and
                             SIGINT and finishes its current queue run and then
                             exits successfully.
                           Minor code formating cleanup and Install script
                             fixes.

2002-12-15      2.9b41     The Mixmaster protocol version is now prepended
                             to the software version in the Mixmaster cap-
                             string.
                           Minor configuration default changes and Install
                             script fixes.
                           Install script now always uses "make" and not
                             "gmake".
                           IDEA detection is fixed on systems that provide
                             the header files but then turn out to not
                             have the required functions upon linking.
                           Install now properly identifies system-wide
                             installations of pcre and/or zlib if they
                             are installed in /usr/local/.
                           Mixmaster will now ensure that an address
                             submitted in a blocking request does not
                             match that of a known remailer before
                             adding it to the dest.blk file (patch
                             submitted by Trek. Vulnerability originally
                             discovered by noise and rabbi.)
                           Minor documentation fixes.

2002-12-16      2.9b42     Minor documentation fixes.
                           Append another newline character to mbox folders
                             when storing a mail so that the mandatory empty
                             line is there.

2002-12-16      2.9.0rc1   Release candidate. Packaging changes only.

2002-12-25      2.9.0      Release version. Minor documentation changes
                             and version number change only.

2003-11-08      2.9.1      Several changes for the Windows build.
                           Some Install script fixes.
                           Fixed a problem in blockrequest() where a buffer
                             could have been used after it was free()'d which
                             resulted in segfaults.
                           Check that feedback buffer is not null before
                             operating on it in chain_select().
                             Closes #631353, thanks Sami Farin.
                           Make sure DH/DSA param file is actually opened
                             before writing to it. Fixes a segfault in
                             case it is not.
                           Handle a pool we cannot read correctly: don't close
                             the NULL dir handle (segfaults on *BSD). We also
                             print a warning in that case now.
                           Minor stats fix (gmtime vs localtime).
                           Fix pool stats bug.

2004-03-20      3.0b1      FEATURE ENHANCEMENTS:

                           The secret pgp keyring is now stored ASCII armored
                             with one key per ascii armor.
                           NB: Due to the bug with reading armored keyrings and
                             secring being stored armored now, it is not
                             advisable to downgrade Mixmaster unless special
                             action is taken to preserve the secret pgp
                             keyring.
                           Mixmaster now prompts for secret key passphrase when
                             started in daemon mode.
                           Mixmaster checks expiration and revocation status of
                             pgp keys, userids, and subkeys.
                           Mixmaster will not encrypt or sign with a revoked
                             or expired key.
                           When encrypting, Mixmaster uses preferences from
                             the primary userid (or the latest userid, if zero
                             or more than one primary userid is present.)
                           Mixmaster keys now have creation and expiration date.
                             It is not secured by any crypto voodoo, it's only
                             informational for clients to decide which keys to
                             use should they have more than one per remailer.
                             - on the client side we do not show remailers (and
                               therefore not use them) if their key is expired.
                             - the remailer refuses to decrypt messages to keys
                               that expired one month ago or earlier.
                             - the remailer automatically creates new Mixmaster
                               keys if the current ones are about to expire or
                               already are expired.
                             - the latest key from secring.mix is written to
                               key.txt. It used to be the first one. Since
                               creation of new mix key appends the key, this
                               seemed sensible.
                           Mixmaster now generates dummy messages automatically
                             as mail enters and exits the pool.
                           Applied Maildir feature patch by drt@un.bewaff.net,
                             with some changes by PP:
                             MAILBOX can now be a Maildir (closes: #586223).
                           New Star-Exclude feature by Colin Tuckley: 
                             User-selected remailers can be excluded from 
                             being chosen as random hops.
                           Have stats on intermediate vs. final hop count
                             (closes: #649900).
                           Add max capability for Type I.
                           Config option EXTFLAGS allows appending additional
                             flags to the capabilities string.  (Hauke Lampe)
                           Config option PRECEDENCE allows setting the
                             Precedence: header on all outgoing mail.
                             (Hauke Lampe)
                           In order to serve help files in different languages
                             we need a way to reply to requests like
                             remailer-help-it.  In order to not have to modify
                             the code for each and every new ressource,
                             Mixmaster now sends the file
                             requests/remailer-<something> to
                             remailer-<something> requests.
                             remailer-{help,key, stats,conf,adminkey} still are
                             special cases though.
                           Drop messages without timestamps and messages with
                             future timestamps.  This abandons backwards
                             compatibility with Mixmaster 2.0.3 and earlier.
                           Mixmaster attempts to detect system clock
                             misconfigurations and refuses to run as a
                             remailer if there is a problem suspected.
                             Only applies to Mixmaster in remailer mode.

                           BUG FIXES:

                           Mixmaster in daemon mode reloads configuration on
                             SIGHUP.
                           In the curses interface chain selection it was not
                             possible to select a random last hop with a usenet
                             post message.  Fixed (closes: #719165).
                           If remix was enabled and we had a Type-I Anon-Post-To
                             request we accidently randhoped it via the
                             configured default remailing chain (default:
                             *,*,*,*).
                             Fixed (closes: #729494).
                           In client mode (REMAIL n) the pool is flushed every
                             time mixmaster is run unless CLIENTAUTOFLUSH is
                             set to n.  (closes: #676794: Rate implementation
                             doubled)
                           Found that weird bug that sometimes led to "Unknown
                             remailer version!" errors: In chain_randfinal() we
                             selected a random value between 0 and maxrem
                             instead of 0 and maxrem - 1.  Mixmaster now uses
                             broken-chain info from stats.
                           Warn if remailer stats are older than a day or
                             from the future.
                           Don't send messages to ourselves via the mailsystem
                             but instead place them in the pool as incoming
                             messages so that they will get processed with the
                             next pool run.
                           No longer try to send a message if there are no
                             recipients left.
                           Set default max-randhops from 20 to 4.
                           Remix-To chain is limited by max-randhops limit as
                             well.
                           Messages to more than one remailer are dropped.
                           Nym support is not compiled in by default anymore.
                           The OpenPGP module mpgp now includes a man
                             page (large contributions by Trek).
                           Ignore 'No reliable remailers' problems when
                             randhopping messages in middleman mode.
                             That is better than dropping them.
                           Experimental feature:  --redirect -l <chain>.
                             If you have a mixmaster message with a
                             chain starting with hop1 (you cannot know any
                             more because it already is encrypted) then
                             mix --redirect -l foo,bar < file
                             redirect the message so the chain is actually
                             foo,bar,hop1,... and places it in your pool.
                             If the total number of hops (which cannot be
                             known) exceeds 20 the message is damanged
                             and will fail at the 20th node.

                           Use /dev/arandom instead of /dev/srandom on 
                             OpenBSD (Nikolay Sturm).
                           Fall back to 3DES as Encrypt-Key cipher if we don't
                             have IDEA. - Laurent Fousse <laurent@komite.net>
                           Also sort mail into the various mboxes if autoreply
                             is not set.
                           Properly ignore whitespace in chain selection.
                           Removed unused functions in keymgt.c.
                           Added new options -V, --version, and --about.
                           Made manpage corrections.
                           Minor ncurses display tweaks.
                           General improvements for Win32 support (by 
                             goblin and Peter Palfrader).
                           Preliminary Windows Installer work.
                           On Win32, default to Application Data/Mixmaster for
                             mixmaster's basedirectory.  This can still be
                             overridden by MIXPATH or the registry entry
                             HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Mixmaster\MixDir
                           Introduced new option "(e)dit configuration 
                             file" in the main menu.
                           Changed 'q)uit' to 'q)uit w/o sending' in 
                             menusend.c.
                           Added stats downloading support. Currently 
                             works under Win32 only (by goblin).
