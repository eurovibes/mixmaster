1999-12-19      2.9beta20  Output remailer RSA keys separately from the
                             DSA/ElGamal keys to avoid problems with old
                             versions of PGP.
                           Messages in mail folders can be deleted. Nym
                             messages and other encrypted mail will be

                           --nym option bug fix (by Adam Back).

2001-09-11      2.9beta24  Changed pool.c to allow Mixmaster keys to pass
                             even when binary blocking is enabled. Note that
                             the solution is not a nice one: It does not
                             recognize Mix keys, it simply allows 10 lines of
                             binary garbage instead of 3. This should be enough
                             for Mix keys to come through (by Peter Palfrader).
                           Fixed a bug in pgpdata.c affecting v3 OpenPGP keys.
                           (by Michael Young).

                             Palfrader).
                           If the sender email address or IP address matches
                             anything in source.blk, ignore the message (by
                             cmeclax).
                           Added support for the Mutt -T option (by Bill
                             O'Hanlon).

2001-09-17      2.9beta30  Version renamed to avoid conflicts with other

                           Better error handling (by Scott Renfro).
                           Added support for multiple dest.blk files. This
                             is needed for the Remailer Abuse Blocklist (by
                             Markus Stöger).
                           Added support for remailer-adminkey replies to
                             provide a better way for remops to distribute
                             their keys. (by Markus Stöger).
                           Fixed errors with pcre2.08 (by Rodney Thayer).
                           Added long command option --type-list for the -T
                             option, and updated help (by Len Sassaman).

                           OpenSSL and OpenBSD Install script issues
                             addressed.

2001-12-16      2.9b33     Support for Mixmaster as a service on Windows
                             platforms added (by Disastry).
                           Problem transparently remixing to Type I remailers

                           Fixed an error in chain.c that was causing

                           Fixed inconsistencies between software name and
                             package name.

2002-07-01      2.9b34     Encrypt-to directive is now supported.
                           Partial packets now properly expire if not
                             reassembled (by cmeclax).
                           Fixed an address blocking error introduced in

                           Various command line bug fixes.

                             middleman remailers (by Kat).
                           Reworked the OpenSSL version check in the

                           Have the Makefile list all prerequisites for each
                             build target (Closes: #584386).
                           Change »majordomo@*« to »majordomo@« in default
                             dest.blk. The dest block engine does not under-
                             stand shell globs. Either substring matches or
                             regexen.
                           Fixed -T switch: if type2.list is not available fall
                             back to pubring.mix.
                           USE_IDEA is no longer default in config.h. It always
                             gets defined by the Install script instead.
                           Only create OpenPGP RSA keys if we compiled with

                           Make all filenames configurable in mix.cfg.

                           The -G option now forces creation of new keys even in
                             client mode (Closes: #585176).
                           Random Documentation updates.

                             script.
                           Fix unused variable warning on OpenBSD.
                           Fix public remailer keys getting re-signed

                           Make smtp sending similar to local /usr/lib/sendmail
                             sending (wrt header/body separation;
                             Closes: #482052).
                           Add X-Loop header on mailbox forwarded messages.
                           Several small fixes by Sami Farin et al.
                           Detach correctly in daemon mode.
                           Minor Install script fixes.

2002-08-20      2.9b37     OpenPGP enhancement release (fixes by Disastry).
                           Fix a small bug in pgpdata.c that stopped Mixmaster
                             from reading cipher preferences.
                           Fixed Passphrase reading in mpgp (the test program)
                             on Windows platform.
                           Add Hash: header when clearsigning.
                           Properly handle RSA keys whose key size is not a
                             multiple of 64.
                           Remove leading zeros from MPI.
                           Use MDC packets whenever possible.
                           List CAST5 and AES128 in cipher preferences.
                           Now displays Mixmaster version in the PGP version
                             header for non remailer/nym messages.

2002-09-11      2.9b38     Install script deals with lack of patented IDEA
                             algorithm in a sane way (closes: #479020).
                           Compiled-in passphrase is now deprecated.
                           When expiring packet ids from id.log also expire
                             packets that are dated more than half a year in
                             the future.  That way we get rid of invalid
                             packets introduced by the switch to a binary file.
                           The stats in remailer-stats replies always had a
                             peak at 00:00 GMT which was wrong. Fixed.
                             (closes: #597688).
                           Fixed a bug with reading armored keyrings consisting
                             of more than one armored block or having comments
                              in front of the one armored block.
                           In RSA PGP keys, we now set e=0x11.
                           Mixmaster now deletes error and temporary files
                             older than PACKETEXP time along with expired
                             partial packets.
                           Linux PPC fixes (and all other archs where char is
                             unsigned).

2002-10-07      2.9b39     Added a new feature, --store-mail (-I), which will
                             deliver an encrypted mix packet to the message pool
                             without attempting being decrypted.
                           Made minor updates for WIN32 DLL.
                           When sending type II messages interactivly you may
                             now choose a middleman remailer as the last hop
                             in your chain (closes: #481244).
                           If a footer.txt file exists its content will be
                             appended to outgoing messages leaving the remailer
                             network at this hop (closes: #490117).
                           List known remailers in remailer-conf reply (closes:
                             #480330).
                           The files created with "SENDMAIL outfile" have
                             different names now to scale beyond 10k files
                             (closes: #587593).
