Thank you for contacting <%CA>. The administrator will
read your message and take appropriate action as soon as possible.

This system is a remailer which automatically anonymizes and forwards
e-mail. As such it serves an important purpose for many of its users
who could not otherwise express themselves freely, or who need to
discuss sensitive personal topics.

Of course, it is not intended to annoy or harass. In case you have
received an unwanted message, the remailer offers a method to prevent
this from happening again.

To block the remailer from sending mail to your address, please send
a message containing the line

DESTINATION-BLOCK

to <%RMA>. You can simply hit `reply' and send back
this entire message.


Remailer Policy:
================

The remailer administrator will take steps to prevent use of the
remailer for any illegal purpose.

The remailer is intended for communicating anonymously, not for
sending unsolicited commercial mail (UCE or spam). If you ever receive
UCE from the remailer, the remailer administrator would appreciate a
complete copy of the message in order to prevent it in the future. UCE
will typically contain a contact address or telephone number, which is
sufficient to identify the sender and -- where applicable -- take
legal action against the originator.


More information about blocking addresses:
==========================================

If you wish to block other addresses you can do so by including one
line of the type "destination-block user@domain" for each address.

As a postmaster, you can block anonymous mail to your entire domain.
To do so, please use the line "destination-block @your-domain.com".

If you do not want to read anonymous messages in mailing lists or
newsgroups, please consult the manual of your mail reading program.
The software will allow you to use `filters' or `kill files' to
avoid being bothered by messages you do not want to read.


Purpose of Anonymous Remailers:
===============================

It is easy to store electronic mail for a long time and to search huge
amounts of data for information about people when they do not expect
it. Thus, the information society may pose a hitherto unknown threat
to everybody's privacy. In totalitarian regimes sending critical
messages may even cause a threat to the senders' lives if their
identity ever becomes known.

For that reason, anonymous remailers have been developed. Remailers
use cryptographic methods to conceal the origin of messages. Each
message is sent through a network of anonymizing servers so that not
even the remailer administrators have any information about the origin
of the message. It is impossible for us to determine the original
sender of any message. Please don't ask, because we don't know either.

whenever a problem occurs or you have any questions.
