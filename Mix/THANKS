Mixmaster Version 3.0 beta

Many people have helped with the development of Mixmaster over the past
nine years. Lance Cottrell wrote the original 1.x and 2.0.x versions. Ulf
Möller contributed significantly to the 2.0.x versions, and wrote the core
code for 2.9 from scratch. I'd like to give special thanks to Janis Jagars
for his valuable code contributions, and to Peter Palfrader, whose 
tireless efforts have made this release possible.

Mixmaster uses Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler's compression library zlib,
Philip Hazel's Perl Compatible Regular Expressions library, the ncurses
library (originally written by Zeyd Ben-Halim and Eric Raymond), and
OpenSSL (based on work by Eric Young and Tim Hudson.)

I have compiled below a partial list of people who have contributed to
Mixmaster's success, through suggestions, bug reports, patches, or other
contributions. Please report any omissions to me.

There have been numerous anonymous contributions to this project as well.
While we obviously can't thank the contributor(s) by name, they are still
very much appreciated.

Thanks also to all the remailer operators, who give their time and service
(and perform what is too often a thankless job) to ensure that our right
to anonymous speech is preserved.
