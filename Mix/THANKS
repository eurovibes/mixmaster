Mixmaster Version 2.9.0


Many people have helped with the development of Mixmaster over the past
eight years. Lance Cottrell wrote the original 1.x and 2.x versions. Ulf
Möller contributed significantly to the 2.0.x versions, and wrote the core
code for 2.9 from scratch. I'd like to give special thanks to Peter
Palfrader, for all of his hard work and assistance in helping me continue
this project, and to Janis Jagars for his valuable code contributions.

I have compiled below a partial list of people who have contributed to
Mixmaster's success, through suggestions, bug reports, patches, or other
contributions. Please report any omissions to me.

Mixmaster uses Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler's compression library zlib,
Philip Hazel's Perl Compatible Regular Expressions library, the ncurses
library (originally written by Zeyd Ben-Halim and Eric Raymond), and
OpenSSL (based on work by Eric Young and Tim Hudson.)

Thanks also to all the remailer operators, who give their time and service
(and perform what is too often a thankless job) to ensure that our right
of anonymity is preserved.
