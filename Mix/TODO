Mandatory todo items before 3.0 release:

* autoconf installation script is needed
* post-install scripts need to be reworked
* provide a packaged Windows build to be used with QuickSilver
* clean up documentation and tarball contents
* do full regression tests on as many platforms possible
  + list only these platforms as supported
* resolve any new critical issues

Items for 3.0 or 3.0.1

* allow for verification of clearsigned OpenPGP messages
* AES support -- requires OpenSSL 0.9.7
* further mpgp testing of AES/MDC packet support
* honor key preferences when encrypting to multiple keys
* Macintosh OS/X support
* Windows build instructions/files
* documentation issues resolved
  + mpgp man page
* check and enforce OpenPGP key expiration date
* further debugging

Further wishlist:

* set an expiration date on OpenPGP keys
* investigate whether and how it is feasible to
  add expiration/creation dates to mixmaster keys
  if feasible, implement setting and checking
* Automatic key handling:
  + create new PGP keys automatically if
    current keys are about to expire 
  + requires implementing key signing, key deletion
  + create new mixmaster keys automatically
    if necessary 
  + Automatically announce new keys?
    - implement remailer-key signing?
    - if yes, which key?
* make mpgp friendlier
