Items that need to be completed before the next HEAD release:

- keylifetime and key{grace,overlap}period needs to be documented once
  it's finished  (rabbi)
- Modify release tarball generation script to build the .tab.c file from
  parsedate.y, so we don't end up requiring bison on every system that
  wants to build mixmaster  (rabbi)
- document experimental --redirect in mix.1  (weasel)
o drop messages without timestamp (weasel)
  - document somewhere  (rabbi)
o drop messages with future timestamp  (weasel)
  - document somewhere  (rabbi)
o Remove nym stuff from the manpage  (rabbi)

  - mostly done -- a few bugs still need fixing  (dybbuk)
- post-install scripts need to be reworked
  - follows item above  (dybbuk)
- ship with CVS ChangeLog
- libraries (pcre, zlib) were removed from the Src directory.
  auto* needs to be updated (dybbuk)

Packaging:
- rpm -- dybbuk

Wishlist:
- don't drop messages if there are not enough reliable remailers.

- clean up documentation and tarball contents
  + reorganize directory structure
  + add a CONTRIBUTORS or THANKS file.   rabbi

Abandoned/Deferred:
D allow for separate hard-coded remailer and client defaults.  n/a
D allow for verification of clearsigned OpenPGP messages  disastry
D honor key preferences when encrypting to multiple keys  ulf/disastry (n/a)
D further mpgp testing of AES/MDC packet support  ulf
D make mpgp friendlier

X nym client needs major work.
  X store nym public keys locally
D find bug that is causing t* files to linger  n/a
D COMMENT entire existing codebase!  (HAHA)
D support for Borland compiler on Windows.
  D I'ld even go so far as drop Visual C (or whatever we're supporting at
    the moment) and require gcc with Cygwin to build it. But only if this
    results in a Binary that runs without additional DLLs. (Weasel)
