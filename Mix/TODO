Mandatory todo items before 3.0 release:

* autoconf installation script is needed
* post-install scripts need to be reworked
* provide a packaged Windows build to be used with QuickSilver
* clean up documentation and tarball contents
* do full regression tests on as many platforms possible
  + list only these platforms as supported
* resolve any new critical issues
* keylifetime and key{grace,overlap}period needs to be documented once
  it's finished; seems to work nicely for mixmaster keys so far, pgp
  still giving problems
  - move self/binding signatures to the secret keyrings
  - display expiration date in ascii summary of keys
  - if there is no expiration date on existing keys,
    do _not_ add one, if there already is an expiration
    date on they key, do _not_ change it
  - only list the latest key of each type in pgpkeys.txt
    (similar to how weasel's patch does it with mix keys)
* saner usage of /dev/[u]random is required
* ship with a CVS ChangeLog in addition to the current
  HISTORY file. It can be created using Karl Fogel's cvs2cl
  script at <http://www.red-bean.com/cvs2cl/>.
  The command to use is: cvs2cl -w -S --no-wrap

Items for 3.0 or 3.0.1

* support a list of remailers not to be selected as *.
* allow for verification of clearsigned OpenPGP messages
* AES support -- requires OpenSSL 0.9.7
* further mpgp testing of AES/MDC packet support
* honor key preferences when encrypting to multiple keys
* Macintosh OS/X support
* Windows build instructions/files
* documentation issues resolved
  + mpgp man page
* find bug that is causing t* files to linger
* further debugging

Further wishlist:

* Automatic key handling:
  + requires implementing key signing, key deletion
  + Automatically announce new keys?  - I don't think this is needed (PP)
    - implement remailer-key signing?
    - if yes, which key?
* make mpgp friendlier
* store nym public keys locally
