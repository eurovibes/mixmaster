Things that really get done before the next release

- Fall back to 3DES as Encrypt-Key cipher if we don't have IDEA.

Items that need to be completed before the next MAIN release:

- check if this applies to mixmaster:
  | If you use *,*,*,frell it should be like this:
  | *,*,*,frell ; copies=5
  | the semi-colon and spaces being exactly where they are
  | is important. * selects a random remailer.
  <5dpo70tp50d0b89hm1a45sighmp0v0cn7l@4ax.com>

- delete secret keys securely after keygraceperiod expires
  (Should this just be a call to an external program? I.e., 
  "/bin/rm -P" or "/usr/bin/shred -fz -n3")? Does this even
  serve a purpose now that journaled FSes are the norm?

- doallow() should check more than one email address in a line
  (patch # 877312)
- destblk request confirmation (patch # 873498)

Packaging:
- Modify release tarball generation script to build the .tab.c file from
  parsedate.y, so we don't end up requiring bison on every system that
  wants to build mixmaster  (rabbi)
- rpm -- dybbuk
- Windows build instructions/files  (packbart?)
- provide a packaged Windows build to be used with QuickSilver
  + Richard has an Installer we can use for this purpose  (rabbi)
- Macintosh OS/X support  (rabbi)
- Update Install script to put files in global system locations if
  invoked by root. Also update to be smart about AES support.
  (dybbuk said he would do this, but status is unclear.)

Wishlist:
- permit CRAM-MD5 SMTP AUTH in addition to LOGIN.  n/a (patch welcome)
- do full regression tests on as many platforms possible
  - list only these platforms as supported
  - test on Solaris 9 on SPARC.
- saner usage of /dev/[u]random is required -- throw warning when not in
  daemon mode (patch 873497 -- needs work)
- clean up documentation and tarball contents
  + reorganize directory structure
- AES support -- requires OpenSSL 0.9.7  dybbuk


Abandoned/Deferred:
D allow for verification of clearsigned OpenPGP messages  disastry
D honor key preferences when encrypting to multiple keys  ulf/disastry (n/a)
D further mpgp testing of AES/MDC packet support  ulf
D make mpgp friendlier
D COMMENT entire existing codebase!  (HAHA)
D support for Borland compiler on Windows.
  D I'ld even go so far as drop Visual C (or whatever we're supporting at
    the moment) and require gcc with Cygwin to build it. But only if this
    results in a Binary that runs without additional DLLs. (Weasel)
