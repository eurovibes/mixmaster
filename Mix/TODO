Items that need to be completed before the next MAIN release:

- delete secret keys securely after keygraceperiod expires
  (Should this just be a call to an external program? I.e., 
  "/bin/rm -P" or "/usr/bin/shred -fz -n3")? Does this even
  serve a purpose now that journaled FSes are the norm?
- implement time-skew sanity checks so that the timestamp, 
  key rotation and key deletion features don't cause havok.

Packaging:
- Modify release tarball generation script to build the .tab.c file from
  parsedate.y, so we don't end up requiring bison on every system that
  wants to build mixmaster  (rabbi)
- rpm -- dybbuk
- Windows build instructions/files  (rabbi)
- provide a packaged Windows build to be used with QuickSilver
  + Richard has an Installer we can use for this purpose  (rabbi)
- Macintosh OS/X support  (rabbi)
- Update Install script to put files in global system locations if
  invoked by root. Also update to be smart about AES support.
- The main binary should be called "mixmaster", not "mix".

Wishlist:
- don't drop messages if there are not enough reliable remailers.
- permit CRAM-MD5 SMTP AUTH in addition to LOGIN.  n/a (patch welcome)
- do full regression tests on as many platforms possible
  - list only these platforms as supported
  - test on Solaris 9 on SPARC.
- saner usage of /dev/[u]random is required  -- throw warning when not in daemon mode
- clean up documentation and tarball contents
  + reorganize directory structure
- AES support -- requires OpenSSL 0.9.7  dybbuk


Abandoned/Deferred:
D allow for separate hard-coded remailer and client defaults.  n/a
D allow for verification of clearsigned OpenPGP messages  disastry
D honor key preferences when encrypting to multiple keys  ulf/disastry (n/a)
D further mpgp testing of AES/MDC packet support  ulf
D make mpgp friendlier
  D mpgp man page  n/a
X nym client needs major work.
  X store nym public keys locally
D find bug that is causing t* files to linger  n/a
D COMMENT entire existing codebase!  (HAHA)
D support for Borland compiler on Windows.
  D I'ld even go so far as drop Visual C (or whatever we're supporting at
    the moment) and require gcc with Cygwin to build it. But only if this
    results in a Binary that runs without additional DLLs. (Weasel)
