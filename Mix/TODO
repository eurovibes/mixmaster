Items that need to be completed before the next MAIN release:

- Full functionality / regression testing around chain operations
  following the recent whitespace bug fix. (everyone)
- Full WIN32 support.
  - rename pop3.cfg to pop3.cfg.txt
  - different editor handling?  if so, provide suggestions.
  - Sane randomness handling
- Remove OpenSSL version checks. Maybe print a message stating the 
  supported versions, and leave it up to the user?

Items to watch:

- Hunt and kill bug in Mixmaster causing echolot pings to be turned
  into permanent t* files.
  [This is a pesky one. Changing the .forward pipe to go through 
   truss first 'fixes' it. Grr. --rabbi]

Items for 3.0.x:

- Make the default mix.cfg file we write more useful.
  Include (commented out) in a user section:
    + SMTPRELAY
- Write a document on how to setup a remailer on windows
    + install as service
    + configure pop3.cfg
- doallow() should check more than one email address in a line
  (patch # 877312) (weasel)
- delete secret keys securely after keygraceperiod expires
  (Should this just be a call to an external program? I.e.
  "/bin/rm -P" or "/usr/bin/shred -fz -n3")? Does this even
  serve a purpose now that journaled FSes are the norm?
- destblk request confirmation (patch # 873498)

Packaging:
- Modify release tarball generation script to build the .tab.c file from
  parsedate.y, so we don't end up requiring bison on every system that
  wants to build mixmaster  (rabbi)
- rpm -- dybbuk
. Windows build instructions/files  (weasel)
- provide a packaged Windows build to be used with QuickSilver
  + Richard has an Installer we can use for this purpose  (rabbi)
- Macintosh OS/X support  (rabbi)
- Update Install script to put files in global system locations if
  invoked by root. Also update to be smart about AES support.
  (dybbuk said he would do this, but status is unclear.)

Wishlist:
- permit CRAM-MD5 SMTP AUTH in addition to LOGIN.  n/a (patch welcome)
- do full regression tests on as many platforms possible
  - list only these platforms as supported
  - test on Solaris 9 on SPARC.
- saner usage of /dev/[u]random is required -- throw warning when not in
  daemon mode (patch 873497 -- needs work)
- clean up documentation and tarball contents
  + reorganize directory structure
- AES support -- requires OpenSSL 0.9.7  dybbuk


Abandoned/Deferred:
D allow for verification of clearsigned OpenPGP messages  disastry
D honor key preferences when encrypting to multiple keys  ulf/disastry (n/a)
D further mpgp testing of AES/MDC packet support  ulf
D make mpgp friendlier
D COMMENT entire existing codebase!  (HAHA)
D support for Borland compiler on Windows.
  D I'ld even go so far as drop Visual C (or whatever we're supporting at
    the moment) and require gcc with Cygwin to build it. But only if this
    results in a Binary that runs without additional DLLs. (Weasel)
