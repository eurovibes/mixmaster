<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<a name="1.1"></a>
<h3>1.1 Document Audience</h3>
This document is intended for those who run or are thinking about running an anonymous remailer, mail2news gateway, or remail statistics pinger. It might answer some questions for those who want to know what these are, but the primary audience is administrators, potential or current.<br><br>
<a name="1.2"></a>
<h3>1.2 What's an anonymous remailer?</h3>
From the <a href=http://www.andrebacard.com/remail.html>Anonymous Remailer FAQ</a>:

<blockquote>
<i>
"A remailer is a computer service which privatizes your e-mail. A remailer is in sharp contrast to the average Internet Service Providers [ISP] which is terribly anti-private. In fact, ISP could equally stand for "Internet Surveillance Point". <a href=http://www.andrebacard.com/email.html>[Click here to Learn About Email Privacy]</a>.
<p>
"Traditionally, a remailer allowed you to send electronic mail to a Usenet news group, or to a person, without revealing your true name or e-mail address to the recipient. Today, new web-based remailers permit you to send mail using your real name (if you wish), while protecting your email records from the snooping eyes of your Internet Service Provider.
<p>

"In the first version of this FAQ (published in 1995), all popular remailers were free-of-charge. Today, a number of services either charge user fees, or support themselves via advertisers.
</i>
</blockquote>

<h3>1.3 Why should I run an anonymous remailer?</h3>
There are several good reasons for running an anonymous remailer. You might be interested if you want to:
<ul>
<li>Promote of free speech
<li>Work against oppresive governments
<li>Help whistleblowers escape retribution
<li>Promote cryptography and anonymity on the Internet
<li>Learn more about running a mail server
</ul>

<a name=2></a>
<h3>2. Planning</h3>
<a name=2.1></a>
<h3>2.1 Requirements</h3>
<a name=2.1.1></a>
<h3>2.1.1 Hardware</h3>
With the right operating system, you can run an anonymous remailer on the most paltry of hardware: some large remailers run on 486 DX 33MHz boxes. Of course, this can only be done if you're running a UNIX-style operating system and if the machine is dedicated to its task. More realistically, especially if you intend to use your hardware for anything else, you should have at least a Pentium 75MHz, with 16MB of RAM.<br><br>
Windows users will need a bit more system resources: at least a Pentium II 200MHz with 64MB of RAM. This is due, of course, to the large overhead of keeping a GUI running.
<a name=2.1.2></a>
<h3>2.1.2 Internet Connectivity</h3>
It is possible to run a remailer without a dedicated connection, as long as you have POP access and an account with a decent quota that won't bounce messages all over the place. This setup is not recommended, however, because it requires constant administrator intervention. Any form of broadband is preferable. Note that, on average, Type II remailers consume anywhere from 84-140 MB per day in bandwidth (3,500-5,000 messages * 28125 bytes/message). Type I remailers typically consume less bandwidth, as they are lower traffic, though this can change if you allow binaries to move through your remailer.
<a name=2.1.3></a>
<h3>2.1.3 Operating System</h3>
Your best bet is probably UNIX, Linux, or a BSD, as these systems are generally free, stable, and relatively secure. Chances are, if you have a well configured machine running this type of operating system, it will be exremely low maintenance. The personal recommendation of the author of this document (though not that of the Mixmaster team at large, as some of them have complaints about OpenBSD's disclosure & advisory policy) is <a href=http://www.openbsd.org>OpenBSD</a>, whose claim to fame -- six years with only one remotely exploitable hole in the default install -- is a good indicator of its security track record.<br><br>
It is possible to run a remailer on a Windows system, but due to the massive security holes and general lack of stability, this is not recommended. If you do choose to run Windows, you will probably have the most success with Windows 2000, as it is the most stable and secure of the Windows operating systems.
<a name=2.1.4></a>
<h3>2.1.4 Software</h3>
Remailers:
<ul>
<li>For Type I and Type II Mixmaster, if you've got a C/C++ compiler, simply grab the <a href=http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=37891>source code</a> off of <a href=http://sourceforge.net/projects/mixmaster/>SourceForge</a> and compile away. This will work on any platform.
<li>Nym remailers are available only in <a href=http://www.skuz.net/potatoware/reli/UserMan.htm>source code form</a>.
<li>For those who really don't want to get their hands dirty, web frontends exist:
  <ul>
  <li><a href=ftp://ftp.shinn.net/pub/freedom-remailer>Freedom</a>, a modified version of the original cypherpunk web frontend (used by the <a href=http://freedom.gmsociety.org>GMS/GILC remailer</a>).
  <li><a href=http://www.cotse.com>COTSE</a>
  </ul>
</ul>
mail2news Gateway:
<ul>
<li><a href=ftp://ftp.shinn.net/pub/remailer/mail2news_gateway>Multipost</a>
</ul>
Pingers for Remailer Statistics:
<ul>
<li>UNIX:
  <ul>
  <li><a href=http://www.palfrader.org/echolot/>Echolot</a>
  <li><a href=http://lexx.shinn.net/cmeclax/pingstats.html>Pingstats</a>: Requires the least of the three, including no database.

  </ul>
</ul>
<a name=2.1.5></a>
<h3>2.1.5 Filesystem/Drive Space</h3>
Actual drive space is probably less of a consideration now than it was in the past, due to the proliferation of extremely large drives. However, it is still good to know how much drive space you should set aside, especially for those running on older systems.<br><br>
Remailers:
<ul>
<li>Type I
  <ul>
  <li>Program Software: 17 MB
  <li>Pool: 10-20 MB
  <li>Database Tables: 2-10 MB
  <li>Outgoing Mail Spool/Queue: 20-300 MB
  <li><b>Grand Total: 49-347 MB</b>
  <li>Note that it's probably best to have flex room above the large end of the grand total, because you don't want to get caught with a full drive during a surge in message traffic.
  </ul>
</ul>
<a name=2.2></a>
<h3>2.2 Decisions</h3>
There are many decisions you will have to make about how to set up your remailer which will impact its ease of administration and performance. Note that you can successfully run a remailer no matter what you decide here; the only thing these considerations are relevant to are your level of involvement in administration.
<a name=2.2.1></a>
<h3>2.2.1 Uptime</h3>
Contrary to what one might first think, it is <b>not</b> necessary to have a box up 24/7 to run a remailer. While an always-on setup is obviously preferable, it is possible to run a remailer on a box without guaranteed uptime, so long as mail is POP'd through at least four times per day. If you cannot send mail through at this minimum rate -- including times when you are away on holiday or otherwise out of your daily -- you should not run a remailer. Doing so would cause unnecessary bottlenecks in the network, causing problems for everyone.
<a name=2.2.2></a>
<h3>2.2.2 Middleman</h3>
In order for the remailer network to function properly, there is a need for "middleman" remailers -- boxes that don't actually send e-mails to recipients or posts to Usenet, but instead simply function as additional hops along the chain (remember, the more hops a message traverses, the more secure it is). These systems are also useful in nym reply blocks.
<br>
If you want to run a remailer, but are afraid of potential consequences from user complaints (i.e. your ISP cutting you off, your friendly neighborhood government getting upset with you), you should run a middleman remailer. Since you will never send messages to anyone but other remailers, you should never get any official complaints, and thus will avoid all of the unpleasantness of dealing with the general public.
<a name=2.2.3></a>
<h3>2.2.3 Nyms</h3>
<a name=2.2.4></a>
<h3>2.2.4 Name</h3>
All remamilers must have a name to identify themselves within the network. This name must not exceed eight characters. Preferably, it should be something easily associated with the remailer, even something humorous, so that it can be easily remembered.
<a name=2.2.5></a>
<h3>2.2.5 Policy</h3>
Before putting your remailer into action, you need to have a clearly articulated policy governing use and abuse of your system (even if you are a middleman, this is a good idea). It should be posted on your web site and be included in autoresponses to non-remailer generated messages (i.e. in abuse.txt). You should probably read <a href=http://mixmaster.shinn.net/abuse.txt>an example</a> before finalizing your own.<br>
Reasons for doing this include: keeping unhappy end-users from escalating complaints by giving them an easy way to resolve problems; being a good netizen; making sure you really know what you're doing and why you're doing it before you start.

<h3>3.1.5.1 TLS-SSL</h3>
TLS-SSL stands for Transport Layer Security-Secure Socket Layer, and it is intended to add an extra layer of security to your mail server's communications. It does so by encrypting all header information when sending mail between MTAs that support it. As any extra level of security is generally a good thing when running a remailer, you are strongly encouraged to install TLS-SSL on your MTA.<br><br>
For those running Qmail, the procedure is rather straightforwrad. Download the <a href=http://inoa.net/qmail/qmail-1.03-tls.patch>patch</a>, apply it to your source tree with "patch < tls.patch", make your server certificates as mentioned in the patch instructions, and re-run "make setup check" to install the updated binaries. Make certain you have run "make clean" first, and that Qmail is shut down during the recompilation (and of course turned back on once successful ;-).

<a href=http://lexx.shinn.net/cmeclax/pingstats.html>Pingstats</a> -- This pinger needs only a Unix account with gpg, Mix 2.9, a mail server, procmail, and a random device; it does not need a database or premail. Capstrings and keyrings are automatically updated and (if tmpwatch is installed) expired. It generates stats in both formats for both Mixmaster and Cypherpunk remailers (but no nymservers yet). To get the source, send a message with subject "get-pingstats" to cmeclax@ixazon.dynip.com. Please allow for the latency of this remailer for delivery (it may take a day or more on a busy day).

<h3>3.3.3 Pinger</h3>
<h3>3.4 Useful System Tools</h3>
<a name=3.5></a>
<h3>3.5 Bounce Re-Inject Script</h3>
cmeclax po'u le cmevi'u ke'umrs written <a href=http://ixazon.dynip.com/~cmeclax/resend>a script</a> (http://ixazon.dynip.com/~cmeclax/resend) which automates the process of re-sending valid messages that have been bounced because of problems with a particular remailer, such as an over-quota account or misconfiguration.
<br><br>
To use it, you need to first put the entireity of the bounced messages into one big file. Alex Kirk has <a href=http://www.schnarff.com/mixmaster/combine>a script</a> (http://www.schnarff.com/mixmaster/combine) which will do this automatically for those running Maildirs.
<br><br>
Once you have your messages in this file, simply run "resend <filename> <remailer@domain>", prefereably as the "mix" user (since, if you were to run this as example_user, messages appear to be coming from example_user@yourdomain). You should probably pick a remailer besides the one that has ben bouncing messages to you, and probably go with one that has a good uptime/statistics history.<br><br>
Keep in mind that this procedure should be repeated regularly, so that a) messages actually get through with some sense of timeliness, and b) you don't end up shooting out hundreds of messages to a particular remailer in one go.
<h3>
<h3>4. Security</h3>
<a name=4.1></a>
<h3>4.1 Host System Security</h3>
Ensuring that the system your remailer runs on is secure is of the highest priority. After all, if the host you are using is cracked, the intruder could do any manner of horrible things, including abusing your mailer and getting your IP blacklisted, shutting down your mailer, compromising your private key, etc. There are several things you can do to protect your host, many of which are one-time-only, policy-oriented fixes.
<h3>4.1.1 Philosophy</h3>
<h3>4.1.2 Firewalls</h3>
<a name=4.1.3></a>
<h3>4.1.3 Minimalism/Unnecessary Software</h3>
Most operating systems come with a great deal of programs and services enabled that you, the administrator, are unaware of and will never use. The number of such programs varies greatly, with Windows in all its forms being the worst offender down to <a href=http://www.openbsd.org>OpenBSD</a>, which ships with almost everything turned off.<br><br>
The reason these programs are relevant to security is simple: if you have a service running that you know nothing about, you're not likely to keep up on exploits related to it. Thus, you're likely to end up with any number of remotely exploitable holes on your system that you're completely unaware of.<br><br>
Your best bet in solving this problem -- besides picking an O/S that isn't a major offender here -- is to scan your box and to find out what services it's running, and then shut down those that aren't relevant to your operations (including, for the most part, those that you have no idea what they do). For UNIX-based systems, first use the "ps" command to check for actively running programs; you can usually turn them off permanently by editing a file like /etc/rc.conf and commenting them out. <br><br>
More importantly, no matter what your O/S is, you should run a port scan from a remote machine, and then go about shutting down ports that offer unnecessary services. A good free web-based port scanner is at <a href=http://crypto.yashy.com/nmap.php>crypto.yashy.com/nmap.php</a>; hitting this URL will tell you what ports you have open and what's running on them.
<h3>4.1.4 Local Attacks</h3>
<h3>4.1.5 Patches/Updates/Upgrades</h3>
<h3>4.2 Key Security</h3>
<a name=4.3></a>
<h3>4.3 Logging</h3>
To log or not to log? That is every remailer's question. ;-)<br><br>
Seriously, though, whether or not you keep your mail server logs is an important decision. The information contained in them could be valuable to any number of malicious entities -- crackers, someone seeking to track down an anonymous message sender, even government entities (which have been known to use subpoenas and other, more devious tactics to obtain logs).<br><br>
If you are serious about protecting the identities of those who mail through you -- particularly if you're not just a middleman remailer, and your server interacts with real users regularly -- you should take precautions regarding your mail server logs. The simplest of these, of course, would be to simply turn your logs off altogether; that way no one can possibly break into them, and even if your records are subpoenaed, you can truthfully and legally say, "But I have none." If you're one of those people who simply can't function without running logs, you should at least use CFS or some other filesystem encryption scheme to protect your logs. Keep in mind that, if you do have logs that you need to erase, no standard O/S delete function will really delete them -- the data will remain recoverable on your hard drive unless you use special data-wiping software (and even then, it may still be recoverable given the proper amount of effort/resources on the attacker's part). Note that some UNIX systems have a flag to rm that will attempt to fully delete a file; so far, none of these perform the necessary steps (with the exception of OpenBSD 3.3 when it is released in April, as a patch was recently added to perform full overwriting). For more info on secure deletion, see <a href=http://www.cs.auckland.nz/~pgut001/pubs/secure_del.html>Peter Guttman's 1996 USENIX paper</a> Note that some UNIX systems have a flag to rm that will attempt to fully delete a file; so far, none of these perform the necessary steps (with the exception of OpenBSD 3.3 when it is released in April, as a patch was recently added to perform full overwriting).

<h3>4.4 Floods & Spam</h3>
<h3>4.4.1 MTA</h3>
<a name=4.4.2></a>
<h3>4.4.2 Asian ISPs & Subnet Filtering</h3>
Many systems administrators of late have noted that a the vast majority of spam being sent these days comes from severs in Asia. A good number of them have taken to blocking off the entire continent at their firewalls in an effort to stop this flood of spam.<br><br>
While reading <a href=http://slashdot.org>Slashdot</a> recently, I came across an <a href=http://slashdot.org/articles/02/11/13/2312228.shtml>article</a> referencing Andy McFadden's <a href=http://www.fadden.com/techmisc/asian-spam.htm>proposal</a> of a slightly less drastic way of slowing this sort of spam. After conducting a study of spam he received, he compiled a list of particularly bad subnets in Asia -- ones whose owners eitehr were not competent to stop spam or simply did not care about it. He suggested that administrators use <a href=http://okean.com/asianspamblocks.html>the lists he compiled</a> to slow spam instead of blocking off an entire continent.<br><br>
Eager to receive less spam, I tried this myself. I am please to report that blocking off these subnets drastically reduced the flow of spam into my inbox, though without measurements from before installing the list I have no scientific evidence of such.

<h3>5.4 Cryptographically Signing Posts & E-mail</h3>
If you're running a remailer, you probably have at least the basic concepts of cryptography down -- at least enough to know that it's possible to cryptographically sign mail messages and Usenet posts, and that doing so helps verify your identity in the message. What you may not realize is that there have been (and will probably continue to be) extremely good forgeries of messages from remailer operators on the official mailing lists. Since someone forging a message could do really nasty things, such as issue bogus keys for your remailer, it is of the utmost importance that you *always* sign your messages, so that a forgery will be obvious (and if a forger has access to your keys to sign your messages, well, you've got bigger problems). Remember, if you only sign messages some of the time, it will be very easy for someone to sneak in and act as you (thought the occasional unsigned post followed two minutes later with a "Crap! Forgot to sign that last one!" post will be understood. ;-).<br><br>
It is even worth your while to sign things like your abuse autoresponse, as forgeries have been known to occur in them as well (particularly when people are accusing you of abuse, and are trying to claim that your abuse policy is not strong enough).

<h3>5.4.1 How To</h3>
The first thing you'll need to do is have <a href=http://www.pgpi.com>PGP</a> or <a href=http://www.gnupg.org>GPG</a>installed. Chances are, if you're here, you've already done this.<br><br>
Once this is done, you'll want to establish a key seperate from your remailer keys as your administrator key. If you've already got a keyset you're officially using, simply use it; if not, generate a new keyset, preferably RSA (as this is stronger than DSS), and at least 1024 bits (thought 2048 wouldn't be bad at all, especially for the paranoid amongst us).<br><br>
As far as getting your mail client to work with PGP/GPG, well, it all depends. For many Windows systems, such as Outlook (Express), Eudora, etc., you can simply use the PGP plug-in. For Mozilla, you'll want to use <a href=http://enigmail.mozdev.org/>Enigmail</a>, which is freely available for all major operating systems. If you use a webmail system, you'll need to check its documentation.

    ``Printer's ink has been running a race against gunpowder these 
      many, many years. Ink is handicapped, in a way, because you can
      blow up a man with gunpowder in half a second, while it may take
      twenty years to blow him up with a book. But the gunpowder destroys
      itself along with its victim, while a book can keep on exploding
      for centuries.''
