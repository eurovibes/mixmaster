<h2>Remailer Clients</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://www.mutt.org/">The Mutt E-Mail Client</a> has an interface to
call the Mixmaster binary.  For <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html">Emacs</a>
Erik wrote an <a href="http://erik.arneson.org/elisp.html">interface</a>:
<a href="http://erik.arneson.org/mixmaster.el">mixmaster.el</a>.

<p>
The <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jbn">JBN</a> project on
sourceforge was just started in order to maintain JBN again and bring it up to
date. (<a href="http://www.theinternet.cc/potatoware/jbn2">old versions</a>)

<p>
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/mixlet">Mixlet</a> is a Mix Client in
Java.  It does not rely on Mixmaster itself to build the messages but rather
implements the required procedures itself.

<p>
Deacon is developing a <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/nymproxy">Nym-Proxy</a>
which lets you use your usual Mail and News clients while still using a Nym.
This is for Unixes.

<p>
<a href="http://quicksilver.skuz.net/">QuickSilver</a> is an actively
maintained and developed client for Win32.  It doesn't call the Mixmaster
binary but instead links against the mix.dll build from Mixmaster's sources.

<p>
<a href="http://www.eskimo.com/~turing/remailer/FAQ/faq.6.html">Section 6 of the alt.privacy.anon-server FAQ</a>
perhaps has a list of more remailer clients.


<h2>Other Remailers</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://www.bigfoot.com/~potatoware/reli">Reliable</a> is
a popular piece of remailer software for Microsoft Windows. It is type I
(cypherpunk) only but has type II callbacks. So if you additionally install
Mix2 or Mix3 on your system it can also do type II. 

<p>
Deacon also created the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/reliable2">Reliable2</a>
project here on SourceForge in order to bring it up to current standards.

<p>
<a href="http://www.mixminion.net/">Mixminion</a> will become the next
generation remailing network (Type III).  It's not yet ready to provide you
with anonymity but it's well on its way.

<p>
Free Haven's <a href="http://freehaven.net/anonbib/">Anonymity Bibliography</a>
has pointers to all the important papers in the anonymity field. It includes
recommended reading lists to get new developers up to speed on remailer designs
and related systems.

<h2>Nymservers</h2>

<p>
The source for the original newnym style nymserver that runs nym.alias.net can be
dowloaded via finger from
<a href="finger:source@nym.alias.net"><code>finger:source@nym.alias.net</code></a>
(you can also send an email to <a href="mailto:source@nym.alias.net">source@nym.alias.net</a>).

<p>
There also is a project that makes the nym.alias.net source work with newer PGP
and GnuPG versions. The project web site is at
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/nymserv">http://sourceforge.net/projects/nymserv</a>.

<h2>Pingers</h2>

For remailers to work in a reliable way it is imperative that remailers and users have
the latest keys and reliability statistics of other remailers. Such data is collected by
programs called Pingers. Either you operate your own or fetch the data from one
of the many existing pingers.
