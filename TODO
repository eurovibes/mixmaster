Mandatory todo items before 3.0 release:

* autoconf installation script is needed
  - mostly done -- Erik needs to check this in to CVS.
* post-install scripts need to be reworked
  - follows item above.
* provide a packaged Windows build to be used with QuickSilver
  - Richard has an Installer we can use for this purpose.
* do full regression tests on as many platforms possible
  + list only these platforms as supported
  + test on Solaris 9 on SPARC.
* keylifetime and key{grace,overlap}period needs to be documented once
  it's finished; seems to work nicely for mixmaster keys so far, pgp
  still giving problems
  - move self/binding signatures to the secret keyrings
  - display expiration date in ascii summary of keys
  - if there is no expiration date on existing keys,
    do _not_ add one, if there already is an expiration
    date on they key, do _not_ change it
  - only list the latest key of each type in pgpkeys.txt
    (similar to how weasel's patch does it with mix keys)
* saner usage of /dev/[u]random is required
* clean up documentation and tarball contents
  + ship with CVS ChangeLog
  + reorganize directory structure
  + add a CONTRIBUTORS or THANKS file.
* resolve any new critical issues


Items for 3.0 or 3.0.1

* permit CRAM-MD5 SMTP AUTH in addition to LOGIN.
* support a list of remailers not to be selected as *.
* allow for verification of clearsigned OpenPGP messages
* AES support -- requires OpenSSL 0.9.7
* further mpgp testing of AES/MDC packet support
* honor key preferences when encrypting to multiple keys
* Macintosh OS/X support
* Windows build instructions/files
* documentation issues resolved
  + mpgp man page
* find bug that is causing t* files to linger
  + rabbi thinks this might have been fixed.
* further debugging (if needed).


Further wishlist:

* Automatic key handling:
  + requires implementing key signing, key deletion
  + Automatically announce new keys?  - I don't think this is needed (PP)
    - implement remailer-key signing?
    - if yes, which key?
* make mpgp friendlier
* store nym public keys locally
* nym client needs major work.
* support for Borland compiler on Windows.
