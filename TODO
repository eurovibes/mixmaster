Todo items before 2.9.1 release:

* permit CRAM-MD5 SMTP AUTH in addition to LOGIN.
* Check and enforce expiration/revocation of OpenPGP keys (?)
* Apply fixes for any new bugs based on existing features


Items that need to be completed before the next HEAD release:

* Fix timezone handling in util.c (or use parsedate?).
* keylifetime and key{grace,overlap}period needs to be documented once
  it's finished.
* Recreate pgpkey.txt regularily with only the latest non-expired keys.
  - prehaps seperate public pgp keyring and pgp key reply file
* Modify release tarball generation script to build the .tab.c file from
  parsedate.y, so we don't end up requiring bison on every system that
  wants to build mixmaster.

Mandatory todo items before 3.0 release:

* autoconf installation script is needed
  - mostly done -- a few bugs still need fixing
* post-install scripts need to be reworked
  - follows item above.
* provide a packaged Windows build to be used with QuickSilver
  - Richard has an Installer we can use for this purpose.
* do full regression tests on as many platforms possible
  + list only these platforms as supported
  + test on Solaris 9 on SPARC.
* saner usage of /dev/[u]random is required
* clean up documentation and tarball contents
  + ship with CVS ChangeLog
  + reorganize directory structure
  + add a CONTRIBUTORS or THANKS file.
* resolve any new critical issues


Items for 3.0 or 3.0.1

* allow for separate hard-coded remailer and client defaults.
* allow for verification of clearsigned OpenPGP messages
* AES support -- requires OpenSSL 0.9.7
* further mpgp testing of AES/MDC packet support
* honor key preferences when encrypting to multiple keys
* Macintosh OS/X support
* Windows build instructions/files
* documentation issues resolved
  + mpgp man page
* find bug that is causing t* files to linger
* further debugging (if needed).


Further wishlist:

* Automatic key handling:
  + requires implementing key signing, key deletion
    - implement remailer-key signing?
    - if yes, which key?
* make mpgp friendlier
* store nym public keys locally
* nym client needs major work.
* support for Borland compiler on Windows.
  - I'ld even go so far as drop Visual C (or whatever we're supporting at
    the moment) and require gcc with Cygwin to build it. But only if this
    results in a Binary that runs without additional DLLs. (Weasel)
* support a list of remailers not to be selected as *.
  - a user suggested allowing filtering regexen over chains.
    useful?  <20021001215010.28351.qmail@nym.alias.net>
* COMMENT entire existing codebase!
