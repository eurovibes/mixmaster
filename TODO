Todo items before 2.9.1 release:

* permit CRAM-MD5 SMTP AUTH in addition to LOGIN.  n/a (patch welcome)
* Update the nymservers in default dest.alw  rabbi


Items that need to be completed before the next HEAD release:

* keylifetime and key{grace,overlap}period needs to be documented once
  it's finished.  weasel
* Modify release tarball generation script to build the .tab.c file from
  parsedate.y, so we don't end up requiring bison on every system that
  wants to build mixmaster.  rabbi
* document experimental --redirect in mix.1  weasel

Mandatory todo items before 3.0 release:

* Remove nym stuff from the manpage  weasel,rabbi
* autoconf installation script is needed
  - mostly done -- a few bugs still need fixing  dybbuk
* post-install scripts need to be reworked
  - follows item above.  dybbuk

  * rpm -- dybbuk
* provide a packaged Windows build to be used with QuickSilver
  - Richard has an Installer we can use for this purpose.  rabbi
* do full regression tests on as many platforms possible
  + list only these platforms as supported
  + test on Solaris 9 on SPARC.
* saner usage of /dev/[u]random is required  -- throw warning when not in daemon mode
* clean up documentation and tarball contents
  + ship with CVS ChangeLog
  + reorganize directory structure
  + add a CONTRIBUTORS or THANKS file.   rabbi
* resolve any new critical issues


Items for 3.0 or 3.0.1

* allow for separate hard-coded remailer and client defaults.  n/a
* allow for verification of clearsigned OpenPGP messages  disastry
* AES support -- requires OpenSSL 0.9.7  dybbuk
* further mpgp testing of AES/MDC packet support  ulf
* honor key preferences when encrypting to multiple keys  ulf/disastry (n/a)
* Macintosh OS/X support  rabbi
* Windows build instructions/files  rabbi
* documentation issues resolved  rabbi
  + mpgp man page  n/a
* find bug that is causing t* files to linger  n/a
* further debugging (if needed).


Further wishlist:

* Automatic key handling:
  + requires implementing key signing, key deletion
    - implement remailer-key signing?
    - if yes, which key?
* make mpgp friendlier
* store nym public keys locally
* nym client needs major work.
* support for Borland compiler on Windows.
  - I'ld even go so far as drop Visual C (or whatever we're supporting at
    the moment) and require gcc with Cygwin to build it. But only if this
    results in a Binary that runs without additional DLLs. (Weasel)
* support a list of remailers not to be selected as *.
  - a user suggested allowing filtering regexen over chains.
    useful?  <20021001215010.28351.qmail@nym.alias.net>
* COMMENT entire existing codebase!
