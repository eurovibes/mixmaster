Subject: Information about %RMN

This message is being sent to you automatically in response to the
message you sent to %RMA with subject "remailer-help".

There is an automated mail handling program installed on this
account which will take any message in the Mixmaster message format
and automatically re-send it anonymously.

You can get the Mixmaster client software via FTP from
<ftp://ftp.zedz.net/pub/crypto/remailer/mixmaster/> (Netherlands) or
<ftp://download.mixmaster.anonymizer.com/pub/source/> (USA). You can
