Mixmaster contains OpenSSL and BSAFEeay. See the file LICENSE.EAY for
details. For use in the US, an RSA patent license must be obtained
seperately.

Installation:
-------------

Mixmaster uses the same source and binary for the remailer program and
the client program. Setting up a client, however, is significantly
easier.

Mixmaster is best used with Private Idaho or Potato.
See README.PI and README.POT for details.

However, it is also possible to run Mixmaster directly from the command
line.

Mixmaster as a command line program
-----------------------------------

You will need a directory to put your Mixmaster files, e.g. C:\MIX.
Set the environment variable MIXPATH to be the full path to the directory
with Mixmaster's files. If MIXPATH is not set, Mixmaster will use the
current directory.

If you are not running Windows, you need the CWSDPMI driver from
<ftp://ftp.coast.net/SimTel/vendors/djgpp/v2misc/csdpmi3b.zip>.

Put a list of Mixmaster remailers (TYPE2.LIS) and their public keys
(PUBRING.MIX) into your Mixmaster directory. You can get a list of
remailers and their keys from WWW page <http://anon.efga.org/anon/>
Or if you're paranoid, get them directly from the remailers and slap
them into the proper files yourself with your favorite editor.

See MANUAL.TXT for instructions on using Mixmaster to create
remailer messages.

The source code package contains information on compiling Mixmaster
in the file DOS\BUILD\README.
