Some notes on building version 2.0.4 for DOS/Windows:

Download the DJGPP packages bnu213b, djdev203b, fil41b, gcc31b, mak3791b
(or newer) from SimTel (see http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/getting.html)
and unzip them. Suggested directory: c:\GNU.

Put the OpenSSL source in Src/ssleay

Edit and run gccenv.bat, then run make in the library directories
(for OpenSSL, only build libcrypto.a; libssl.a is not needed), then in
the mixmaster source directory.
