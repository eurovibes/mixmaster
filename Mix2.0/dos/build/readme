Some notes on building version 2.0.5 for DOS/Windows:

Download the DJGPP packages bnu215b, djdev203, fil41b, gcc333b, mak3791b
(or newer) from SimTel (see http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/getting.html)
and unzip them. Suggested directory: c:\GNU.

Put the OpenSSL source in Src/ssleay

Edit and run gccenv.bat, then run make in the library directories
(for OpenSSL, you only need to build libcrypto.a, libssl.a is not used;
however with a complete DJGPP build environment it should be possible to
build OpenSSL 0.9.7 as described in the OpenSSL docs), then in
the mixmaster source directory.
