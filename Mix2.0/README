Mixmaster can be used with either of the cryptographic libraries
RSAREF or OpenSSL. The Src directory should contain a directory (or
symbolic link) named `rsaref' or `ssleay' (for legacy reasons). Mixmaster 
also checks for OpenSSL in /usr/local/ssl. OpenSSL is available from
<URL:http://www.openssl.org/source/openssl-0.9.6g.tar.gz>.

Installation:
-------------

To install or upgrade Mixmaster, type `./Install'.

The Mixmaster remailer can be installed on any account that can
receive mail.  Non-remailer messages will be delivered as usual.  See
the manual page mixmaster(1) for instructions on using Mixmaster and
for details about Mixmaster as a remailer.

You can get a list of Mixmaster remailers (type2.list) and their public
keys (pubring.mix) by running the script "getlist" in the directory where 
these files are to be stored. This script will also obtain a list of reliable
remailers (mix.list).  If you're paranoid, get them directly from 
the remailers and slap them into the proper files yourself with your 
favorite editor. The mix.list file can be obtained from the WWW by running
"lynx -dump http://stats.melontraffickers.com/mlist.txt >$MIXPATH/mix.list".
This command can be run periodically using cron.
