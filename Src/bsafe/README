BSAFEeay alpha 1
===========================================================

BSAFEeay is a free, public domain implementation of RSA Data
Security's BSAFE API, using the SSLeay crypto library. 
BSAFEeay was developed based on the BSAFE API spec as found 
in public domain code such as SETREF. 

NOTE: If you want to legally use BSAFEeay in the US, you must
license RSA from RSA Data Security, Inc. BSAFEeay is NOT a
product of RSA Data Security and conveys no license for the
algorithms within.

BSAFEeay requires the SSLeay crypto library, visit
	http://www.psy.uq.oz.au/~ftp/Crypto/
for details on SSLeay, where to get it, etc.

BSAFEeay also needs a patch to SSLeay 0.8.1 to enable RSA_NO_PADDING 
support. You can get the patch at:
	ftp://ftp.psy.uq.oz.au/pub/Crypto/SSL/nopadding.patch

NOTE: this is ONLY for SSLeay 0.8.1. When 0.8.2 is released,   
it will support RSA_NO_PADDING without the patch. To use BSAFEeay 
with SSLeay 0.8.1, you must have this patch. To install the patch, 
cd to the the SSLeay-0.8.1 directory, and type:
	cat /path/to/the/patch | patch -p0 
where /path/to/the/patch is the path to the patchfile you downloaded.
Do this BEFORE running Configure and make.

BSAFEeay is meant for developers and people who like to get
their hands dirty in code. It is NOT an end-user product and
the authors will ignore any questions not directly related
to BSAFEeay.

THE BSAFEEAY DISTRIBUTION:

  BSAFEeay includes the following files:

  bsafeeay.c
  bsafeeay.h
  Makefile
  README (this file)
  COPYRIGHT (your license, our copyright)
  atypes.h (0 length placeholder so #includes don't break)
  aglobal.h (0 length placeholder so #includes don't break)
  bsafe.h (simply includes bsafeeay.h)


BUILDING BSAFEEAY:

  BSAFEeay will untar into its own directory, called bsafeeay.
  cd to BSAFEeay and edit the Makefile to point to the correct SSLeay
  include directory, then type 'make'. You may want to edit CFLAGS in the
  Makefile to provide for optimization or debugging, etc.


LINKING BSAFEEAY INTO APPLICATIONS:

  Simply add -LBSAFEEAY_DIR -LSSLEAY_DIR -lbsafe -lcrypto to your
  link line in your Makefile, where BSAFEEAY_DIR is the location
  of libbsafe.a, and SSLEAY_DIR is the location of libcrypto.a


PACKAGES AND APPLICATIONS WHICH WORK WITH BSAFEEAY:

  BSAFEeay is a work in progress. Currently (as of alpha 1) SETREF
  is the only package known to work. However, anything that uses
  only the implemented parts of BSAFEeay should work as well.
  Check https://www.cypherpunks.to/ for updates.
